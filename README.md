## Description
Creating a readme file from command line. 

* The questions, require(s), writetofile, and init set up was mostly done in the index.js file. I tried a new form validate, to reassure that all of the questions are answered.

* The markdown file was the tricky part, with the three license functions and the actual generate markdown function.

## Installation
* We used node.js and JS to generate a readme file. We used an index.js file in conjunction with a markdown.js file.
